  title: LSST Science Pipelines
  description: |
    The LSST Science Pipelines are designed to enable optical and
    near-infrared astronomy in the “big data” era. While they are being
    developed to process the data for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
    of Space and Time (Rubin’s LSST), our command line and programming
    interfaces can be extended to address any optical or
    near-infrared dataset.
